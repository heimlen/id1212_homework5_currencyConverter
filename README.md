# id1212_homework5_currencyConverter
Fifth homework in course ID1212 taken on KTH. The assignment was to create an android application, and I choose to create a currency converter, like the previous homework.

Application utilizes fixer.io API for conversion rates ; http://fixer.io/ 

Application is created for Android 6 Marshmallow, but should work without issues on later Android versions as well.

Application has been briefly tested on Nexus 6P VM running Android 6.0 x86 Marshmallow, as well as thorougly tested on OnePlus 3
running Android 8.0 Oreo.
